This is the experimental new ooc frontend. It's a work in progress under heavy development.

The goals are correctness and speed. For that matter, it's implemented in a more lightweight way than the old
parser, and way more cleanly, with a testing-first development process.

Why write a new parser/frontend ?
  * The current one is too hackish for the future
  * It's better to have a solid foundation on which to add features
  * It will be shorter than fixing bugs in the current one (e.g. it has fundamental design issues)
  * The new frontend is designed to be more flexible than the old one, thus it'll be easier
  to plug in new backends.
